[21:40:21.077] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[21:40:21.077] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[21:40:21.083] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
