The Subscription Object
A subscription is created when a subscription product is purchased. Bills the customer on a recurring basis.

A subscription belongs to a Store and is associated with a Customer, an Order, an Order Item, a Product, a Variant, Subscription invoices and Subscription items.

Attributes

The ID of the store this subscription belongs to.

customer_id
The ID of the customer this subscription belongs to.

order_id
The ID of the order associated with this subscription.

order_item_id
The ID of the order item associated with this subscription.

product_id
The ID of the product associated with this subscription.

variant_id
The ID of the variant associated with this subscription.

product_name
The name of the product.

variant_name
The name of the variant.

user_name
The full name of the customer.

user_email
The email address of the customer.

status
The status of the subscription. One of

on_trial
active
paused - The subscription’s payment collection has been paused. See the pause attribute below for more information.
past_due - A renewal payment has failed. The subscription will go through 4 payment retries over the course of 2 weeks. If a retry is successful, the subscription’s status changes back to active. If all four retries are unsuccessful, the status is changed to unpaid.
unpaid - Payment recovery has been unsuccessful in capturing a payment after 4 attempts. If dunning is enabled in your store, your dunning rules now will determine if the subscription becomes expired after a certain period. If dunning is turned off, the status remains unpaid (it is up to you to determine what this means for users of your product).
cancelled - The customer or store owner has cancelled future payments, but the subscription is still technically active and valid (on a “grace period”). The ends_at value shows the date-time when the subscription is scheduled to expire.
expired - The subscription has ended (either it had previously been cancelled and the grace period created from its final payment has run out, or it was previously unpaid and the subscription was not re-activated during dunning). The ends_at value shows the date-time when the subscription expired. Customers should no longer have access to your product.

For example, when status is active, status_formatted will be Active and past_due will be Past due.
