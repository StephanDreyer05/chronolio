# Rules to follow

- Focus on solving the core issue in an efficient manner with as little as possible additional code
- Don't fix or change things not related to the core issue we are solving
- Keep fixes simple and don't try multiple fixes at the same time
- Take one approach and follow through
- Preferably, don't create and run scripts unnecessarily
